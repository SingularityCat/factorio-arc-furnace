[mod-setting-description]
ArcFurnace-CraftingSpeed=Default is 80, decrease to slow down, increase to speed up.
ArcFurnace-type=Default is "furnace". Vanilla furnace-like smelting or selecting recipe like assembling machine.
ArcFurnace-crafting-category=Default is "arc-smelting". Change the crafting category of the arc furnace. "arc-smelting" creates scaled recipe for the arc furnace and "smelting" doesn't. However, when chosing "smelting", due to the limitations of the game engine, it is recommended to use a mod such as "Deadlock Stacked Recipes" to circumvent those game engine limitations. "smelting+kiln" is for both the smelting and kiln category, since kiln was added in Space Exploration 0.6
ArcFurnace-space-platform=Default is false. Allow the Arc Furnace in space?
