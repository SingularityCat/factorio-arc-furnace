I've abandoned this - it was basically a big broken furnace I fixed for a deathworld with some friends a few years ago.
There are better mods for this out there.

Improved version of the Arc Furnace mod by PoxyDoxy.

This version generates recipes from existing ones, rather than hardcoding a list.
As a result, it should work with any mod that adds smelting recipes.
(It also tweaks a couple of other things.)

This mod uses modified art assets from Krastorio 2 by raiguard (and others).
